# Redis in Python

This project is for fun learning how to make a Redis clone which support basic command like `GET`, 
`SET`, `PING` and `ECHO`


Among the cool features covered:
* WebSockets
* Event loops with multithreading for serving multiple client
* RESP protocol for message exchange
* Redis client and server

Running local server is simple as `bash spawn_redis_server.sh`
Running local client `bash spawn_redis_server.sh`
